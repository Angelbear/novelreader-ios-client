# Introduction

**MSNavigationPaneViewController** was written by **Eric Horacek** for **[Monospace Ltd.](http://www.monospacecollective.com)**

`MSNavigationPaneViewController` is a view controller that handles the presentation of two overlaid child view controllers. The "pane" view can moved with a swipe gesture to reveal the "master" view below. This interface paradigm easily enables the navigation seen in Facebook, Path, and many others.

There are a number of great reasons to use `MSNavigationPaneViewController` over of the many other similar overlaid view controller classes:

* This class was written with an emphasis on simplicity. Its interface is about as simple as they come, and is easy to extend.
* It features a smooth bounce animation when the navigation pane is flicked in either direction based on the velocity of the swipe gesture.
* There are various appearance types and open directions available to customize its visual style.
* It doesn't require for you to subclass your pane or master view controllers to add them as child view controllers. 
* The swipe gesture to reveal the master view controller doesn't interfere with `UITableViews` or other `UIScrollViews` added to the pane view controller's view.
* When a new pane view controller is set using the `setPaneViewController:animated:completion:` method, it is first animated off to the right, replaced, and then animated back to the left. This prevents a jarring "pop-in" effect when a new pane view controller replaces the current view.

# Open Directions

* **Left** (`MSNavigationPaneOpenDirectionLeft`) – Default open direction. The navigation pane opens from the left. A left-right swipe can also reveal the master view.

* **Top** (`MSNavigationPaneOpenDirectionTop`) – The navigation pane opens from the top. A top-bottom swipe can also reveal the master view.

# Appearance Types

There are a few types of appearance available for `MSNavigationPaneViewController`. They each change some aspect of the visual style of the pane view dragging. The appearance type of the navigation pane is set via the `navigationPaneViewController.appearanceType` accessor. The possible types are as follows:

* **None** (`MSNavigationPaneAppearanceTypeNone`) – Default appearance. Doesn't change the master view's appearance in any way as the pane view is dragged.
* **Parallax** (`MSNavigationPaneAppearanceTypeParallax`) – Scrolls the master view in from the right as the pane view is dragged.
* **Zoom** (`MSNavigationPaneAppearanceTypeZoom`) – Zooms the master view in from an inset state as the pane view is dragged.

The default value of the appearance type is `MSNavigationPaneAppearanceTypeNone`.

# Touches

## Forwarding Touches

To forward touches through views that require a swipe/pan gesture so that the `MSNavigationPaneViewController` doesn't intercept them, simply add their `Class` to `touchForwardingClasses`:

```  objective-c
[navigationPaneViewController.touchForwardingClasses addObject:UISwitch.class];
```

Both `UISlider` and `UISwitch` are included by default.

## Disabling Pane Dragging

To disable dragging of the pane and prevent `MSNavigationPaneViewController` from intercepting touches, set 

```  objective-c
navigationPaneViewController.draggingEnabled == NO;
```

# Examples

Two examples for `MSNavigationPaneViewController` are included in the "Example" directory, to run them open `Examples.xcworkspace`:

The example projects depend on `PRTween`, which is included as a git submodule. To install, run the following:

```  bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

* `Example.xcodeproj` – No Storyboards or Nibs
* `Storyboard Example.xcodeproj` – Use with Storyboards
